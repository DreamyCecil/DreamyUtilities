# Dreamy Utilities

**Dreamy Utilities** is a framework of simple header libraries that extend C++ functionality via a collection of convenient modules.

The main inspirations behind many design choices are Boost and Qt frameworks.

Visit [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/DreamyCecil/DreamyUtilities/wiki) for details and information about different libraries.

### Utilizes
- C++ Standard Library
- Boost 1.34.1 (optionally through macros)

### Tested compilers
- **MSVC**: v60, v100, v120, v142
- **GCC**: 9.4.0

# How to use
1. Include `DreamyUtilities.cpp` somewhere in your project **once** to make the framework compile some of its implementations.
2. Include any header (`.hpp`) from any library to utilize its functionality.
